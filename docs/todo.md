* Creating gatsby jsx pages

* What's graphql and why is it here?
    * GRAPHQL IS BAE
    * Do a section on converting Graphql to routes

* Routes:
    * Routes are a super useful thing to have a kata on
    * There's the file system routes {MarkdownRemark.name}
        * Does the query inside of this file, also filter out which files are being selected?

* Alternative routing:
    * If you want more complex queries, you have to use the gatsby-node.js file
    * gatsby-node.js will run on start up
    * Your routes can be defined in here too
    * You can use the more complex graphql queries too

* Gatsby is basically:
    * Graphql 
    * Routes

* Embedding content in other pages
    * I want to embed one page into another
    * Not using iframes

* Dynamic link generation:
    * Use gatsby
    * I want it to dynamically generate a list of links to pages automatically

* State persistance and toggles
    * This would be a react part
    * Saving state
        * Retrieving state
        * Very basic. I'm looking to save a single boolean
    * A toggle to hide / show code examples
