# We're doing REACT stuff this time around
* <Link> There's this?!
    * import { Link, graphql } from 'gatsby'

* Mapping:
    * <Link key={index} to={name}> Value </Link>

* I could have a quick section on Some React stuff
    * Layout Components:
        * src/components/layout.js
        * https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/layout-components/ 
        * Again, wrap your pages in a layout component
        * combine it with https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/#wrapPageElement
        * That auto wraps your page with content

* State persistance and toggles
    * This would be a react part
    * Saving state
        * Retrieving state
        * Very basic. I'm looking to save a single boolean
    * A toggle to hide / show code examples
