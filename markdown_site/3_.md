# Filesystem Routing:

# Create some routes:
* Create Some embedded files
    * src/pages/first/one.md
    * src/pages/first/two.md
    * src/pages/second/one.md
    * src/pages/second/two.md

* Play with some __graphql routes

* Make the routes:
    * Use the {MarkdownRemark.parent__(File)__relativeDirectory}/{}.js 
    * <root>/directory/filename
        * <root>/first/one
        * <root>/first/two
        * <root>/second/one
        * <root>/second/two

* Route to them
    * You're going to need a similar to the routing query
    * Render those on index.js


# Auto route generation

* Auto route generation:
    * Can i get 
        * directory/first and 
        * directory/second 

* Auto route generation II:
    * Can i get index.js to route to src/pages/markdown/first and second?

* Can i filter this way?
