# Filesystem Routing:

* Create Some embedded files
    * src/pages/markdown/first/one.md
    * src/pages/markdown/second/one.md
    * src/pages/markdown/first/two.md
    * src/pages/markdown/second/two.md

* Play with some __graphql routes

* Convert those into routes
    * Use the {Markdown}/{MoreStuff}.js 

* Auto route generation:
    * Can i get directory/first and directory/second to route using the same file?

* Auto route generation II:
    * Can i get index.js to route to src/pages/markdown/first and second?

* Filter?
